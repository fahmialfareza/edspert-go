# Final Project

The final project, you will create `Rest API with Gin Gonic`. The requirements are below.

- You have to create three tables. The tables are `artists`, `albums` and `songs`. `An artist` can have `many albums` and `an album` can have `many songs`.
- You have to use `Postgres` for database.
- You can use `Redis` for caching (optional).
- You have upload the rest api to `Railway` or `another Cloud` that support `Go`.

### Response Format

```
{
  "status": bool,
  "message": string,
  "errors": []string,
  "data": interface{}
}
```

- `status` must be a boolean, if success it will `true` and error it will `false`
- `message` must be a string
- `errors` must be array of strings
- `data` can be an `object` or `array object` or `can be anything`
